EPIC AI CREATIVE STUDIO - PROJECT GOALS & CONTEXT
=================================================

PROJECT VISION:
Transform the current frontend-only mock interface into a fully functional AI-powered creative platform for generating images, videos, infographics, and slides.

CURRENT STATE:
- Beautiful Next.js 14 + shadcn/ui frontend ✅
- Complete UI mockups for all 4 creative tools ✅
- Theme system and responsive design ✅
- v0.app sync integration ✅
- NO BACKEND FUNCTIONALITY ❌

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Phase 1 - Weeks 1-3):
===========================================
1. Set up Supabase database with proper schema and RLS
2. Implement Supabase Auth for user management
3. Create basic API infrastructure with error handling
4. Add real OpenAI DALL-E integration for image generation
5. Implement file storage system with Supabase Storage
6. Create project save/load functionality

PHASE 2 GOALS (Weeks 4-6):
==========================
- Add video generation with Runway/Pika APIs
- Expand to Stability AI for more image options
- Build comprehensive file management system
- Add generation history and user analytics

PHASE 3 GOALS (Weeks 7-9):
==========================
- Enhanced informatics with real chart generation
- Advanced slides editor with templates
- Local model support (Stable Diffusion, etc.)
- Project sharing and collaboration features

PHASE 4 GOALS (Weeks 10-12):
============================
- Stripe payment integration
- Usage tracking and quota management
- Subscription tiers (Free, Pro, Enterprise)
- Advanced user management and admin features

TECH STACK DECISIONS (LOCAL-FIRST):
===================================
Database: Supabase ✅ (PostgreSQL with auth)
Authentication: Supabase Auth ✅ (simpler than Clerk)
AI Text Generation: Ollama + Llama3.1 ✅ (free, local)
AI Image Generation: ComfyUI + Stable Diffusion XL ✅ (free, local)
AI Vision: Ollama + LLaVA ✅ (free image analysis)
File Storage: Supabase Storage ✅ (integrated solution)
Payment: Stripe (Phase 4 - when ready to monetize)
Charts: Recharts (Phase 3)

CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:
========================
1. User can sign up and authenticate securely
2. Image generation works with real AI models
3. All generated content is properly stored and retrievable
4. Projects can be saved, loaded, and shared
5. Payment system handles subscriptions correctly

NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (LOCAL-FIRST):
====================================
1. Install Ollama for local AI text generation
2. Install ComfyUI for local image generation
3. Set up Supabase project for data persistence (auth + storage)
4. Create local AI client libraries (Ollama + ComfyUI)
5. Build API routes for local AI integration (/api/local/generate/)
6. Test local models before adding any paid APIs

KEY QUESTIONS TO RESOLVE:
========================
- Supabase Auth vs Clerk for authentication? (Recommendation: Supabase)
- Start with DALL-E or Stability AI first? (Recommendation: DALL-E)
- Local model support in Phase 1 or 2? (Recommendation: Phase 2)
- OpenAI API budget available for testing?
- Custom domain planned or use Vercel default?

TESTING STRATEGY:
================
- Unit tests for database utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints  
- E2E tests for user workflows
- Manual testing for AI integrations

DEPLOYMENT NOTES:
================
- Vercel deployment already configured ✅
- v0.app sync working ✅
- Need to add environment variables to Vercel
- Supabase handles database hosting
- Consider CDN for generated assets

RISK MITIGATION:
===============
- Start with most reliable AI provider (OpenAI)
- Implement proper error handling and retries
- Use Supabase's built-in RLS for security
- Add usage quotas to prevent abuse
- Regular backups of user data

STATUS: Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation
NEXT MILESTONE: Working authentication + image generation (2 weeks)
