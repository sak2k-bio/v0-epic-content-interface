# Epic AI Creative Studio - Development Plan

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ What's Implemented (Frontend Only)
- **UI Framework**: Complete shadcn/ui component system with Tailwind CSS
- **Theme System**: Dark/light mode switching with CSS variables
- **Navigation**: App Router structure with proper routing between sections
- **Mock Interfaces**: All four main sections have detailed UI mockups:
  - Image Generation (DALL-E, Stable Diffusion models UI)
  - Video Generation (Runway, Pika Labs models UI)
  - Informatics (Chart designer with data manipulation)
  - Slides (Presentation editor with slide management)
- **Model Management**: UI for local/online model switching and status tracking

### ❌ What's Missing (Critical Functionality)
- **No Backend API**: All interactions are simulated with setTimeout
- **No Database**: No data persistence for projects, settings, or user data
- **No Authentication**: No user management or authorization
- **No Real AI Integration**: No actual API calls to AI services
- **No File Management**: No image/video upload, storage, or export
- **No Project System**: No saving/loading of user work
- **No Payment Integration**: No monetization or usage tracking
